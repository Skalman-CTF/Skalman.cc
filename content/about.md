# Hi, we are Skalman

Skalman, Swedish for Shellman. Whats in the name? A tortoise, or a hacker popping shells?
In our case; both!

We are a group of security enthousiast, colleagues, friends and/or vague acquaintances. As we regularely participate in CTFs, it sounded like a good idea to share some of these CTFs and how we solved them right here.

In addition, you might find a useful script or two on [our Github](https://github.com/Skalman-CTF/).
