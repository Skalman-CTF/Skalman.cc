      <description>Houseplan CTF This was a crazy CTF, organized by Hack Club and hosted by RiceTeaCatPanda. Organized as we are, we never even realized who or what organized this CTF. But apparently Hack Club is the world largest network of high schoolers/students who are in for a game of &amp;lsquo;lets blow some shit up&amp;rsquo; (responsibly that is). Fun!
CTF Time  Start: Friday 24-04-2020 21:00 (CET) End: Sunday 26-04-2020 21:00 (CET) Categories: Beginner, Crypto, Forensics, Misc, OSINT, Pwn, Reverse Engineering, Web  &amp;ldquo;Where is Elon?</description>

      <description>Hi, we are Skalman Skalman, Swedish for Shellman. Whats in the name? A tortoise, or a hacker popping shells? In our case; both!
We are a group of security enthousiast, colleagues, friends and/or vague acquaintances. As we regularely participate in CTFs, it sounded like a good idea to share some of these CTFs and how we solved them right here.
In addition, you might find a useful script or two on our Github.</description>
